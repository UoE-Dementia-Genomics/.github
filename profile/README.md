# Welcome to the University of Exeter Dementia Genomics Group Github Page

## About us
We are a team dedicated to investigating the genomics of dementia. We perform genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic analyses of a wide range of dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, Lewey body dementia, and Huntington's disease. The majority of our work uses post-mortem brain samples from human donors, but we also work with blood and animal models. 

## About the GitHub page
On this page, you will find code relating to our papers. These are separated by publication and each repository contains all code relating to that paper.
